    {id: 'combat', title: 'Penetration & collaterals', items: [
      'Material-aware entry/exit rays carry damage through penetrable cover and multiple opponents. Range collaterals preserve physical target-mesh scoring.',
      'Shotgun pellets share discharge-level feedback and scoring; armor is consumed across pellets rather than reused for each hit.',
      'Installed-build recoil tables, shotgun patterns, spread transforms and penetration arithmetic have new offline verification fixtures.',
    ]},
    {id: 'weapons', title: 'Weapons & actions', items: [
      'Nova, XM1014, MAG-7, Sawed-Off and Zeus x27, with extracted cadence, accuracy, recoil, range and reserve data. Zeus is also available on slot 4.',
      'Finite reserves, magazine and interruptible shell reload states, slower silent reloads while holding R, and Zeus recharge.',
      'Knife slash/stab, hit/miss cooldowns and backstabs in Duel. Shotguns have ten native finishes each; Zeus has its seven available native finishes.',
    ]},
    {id: 'movement', title: 'Movement & traversal', items: [
      'Shared player/bot hull contacts, step-up, ramp, ladder, shallow-water and partner-support handling.',
      'Current native landing-factor arithmetic, centered bunnyhop window, jump-spam rejection and crouch/contact regressions.',
      'Experienced bots can quietly climb authored routes and coordinate partner boosts through the same physics as the player.',
    ]},
    {id: 'arenas', title: 'Arenas & team tactics', items: [
      'Fifteen new traversal/environment POIs add stairs, ramps, lofts, ladders, vents, glass, sliding gates and movable cargo to the existing cover catalog.',
      'Doors, breakable panels and displaced props update combat, movement, rendering and acoustics together.',
      'Evidence-led trades, synchronized entries, crossfires, shadow cues and knife-equipped opponents. Hidden enemy positions do not grant firing permission.',
    ]},
    {id: 'bot-behavior', title: 'Duel behavior', items: [
      'Committed weapon/range-aware exchanges and shot-confirmed burst timing replace repeated empty peek loops.',
      'Counterstrafe re-engagements, nearby-cover resets and changing firing lines keep open fights active while preserving deliberate escapes.',
      'Steadier uncertain sound bearings and fresh-audio priority improve contact expectations without revealing hidden targets.',
    ]},
    {id: 'connection', title: 'Responsive combat, radar & armor', items: [
      'Removed simulated network latency, delayed input and hit feedback, prediction replay and shot rewind. Old saved ping settings are ignored.',
      'A compact rotating radar shows visible contacts and expiring last-known positions, with zoom and visibility controls.',
      'Independent Kevlar, helmet and armor-condition controls for both sides and individual opponents, with armor-aware XP weighting.',
    ]},
    {id: 'presentation', title: 'Animation, audio & performance', items: [
      'Lazy native weapon gestures with stable anchors, phase-matched reloads and event-timed native weapon foley.',
      'Cover-aware directional audio, immediate hit-frame skeletal death physics and pooled Zeus electrical wires instead of a firearm flame.',
      'Fewer duplicate skeleton updates, compatible mesh batching, bounded caches, cached terrain routing and radar sizing fixes; shot math is unchanged.',
    ]},
    {id: 'performance', title: 'Frame rate & monitoring', items: [
      'Allocation-light cover rays, contributing-animation scheduling and memoized Duel setup reduce repeated CPU work.',
      'Fixed untracked dropped weapons accumulating across rounds; allocation-light corpse contacts and sleeping-pose reuse reduce post-kill CPU work.',
      'A toolbar FPS toggle and CPU-aware automatic pose sampling make performance easier to monitor and adapt without changing gameplay timing.',
    ]},
    {id: 'controls', title: 'Keybinds & CS2 configs', items: [
      'Settings > Keyboard / Mouse mirrors CS2\'s own page, extracted from the installed game: every bind section and option, with click-to-rebind for keys, mouse buttons and the wheel.',
      'Import autoexec.cfg and CS2\'s saved cs2_user_keys/convars files. Aliases, toggle scripts, +/- binds, exec chains, sensitivity, zoom sensitivity, duck/walk toggles and viewmodel FOV/offsets behave as in CS2; Export writes a matching .cfg.',
      'Range, AI Duel and the movement lessons follow your binds, including chorded mouse buttons. HUD hints and fullscreen shortcut protection use your keys; slot 3 cycles knife and Zeus as in CS2.',
